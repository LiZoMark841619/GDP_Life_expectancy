# GDP_Life_expectancy

This project is including GDP and Life expectancy data for 6 countries in 16 consecutive years regarding both developed and developing countries. 
The main goal is to explore the relationship between these different kinds of data, for example, whether growing GDP means higher life expectancy or not in every case, and maybe needless to say that we can also find out during this time under examination what happened with GDP and expected age in those countries.

This is a group project for practice purposes related to Data Analysis from Codecademy.

The main goal is to make and explore some statements.

To achieve the goals and to present the correlations it is essential to make some data visualization charts as well in a readable and understandable form.
